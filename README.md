# exam_rank_02

This repo contains the exercises for the Exam Rank 02.
I have commented and explained what I considered important or worth remembering for the exam. Most of the exercises contain cases that need to be taken into account, so it is worth knowing them.
Also, it is a good idea to practice with the grademe tool to get confident and see the traces of our mistakes:

GOOD LUCK !!!

P.S.: I succeeded 100% with first_word, do_op, ft_atoi_base & ft_split.
